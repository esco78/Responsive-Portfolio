# Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

For this project I created a webpage which incorporates Bootstrap elements in order to make the site responsive to user's screen size. This webpage incorporates 3 HTML files all linked together in order to display an 'About Me', 'Contact', and 'Portfolio' page. My motivation behind this project was to dive in and get a first hand experience with bootstrap and its plethora of elements as well as allow myself to give some background about my personal life. Throughout the process, I gained a considerable amount of experience working with Bootstrap as well as learning to commit every change I make immediately to a GitHub repository in order to have a view of version histories. There were multiple times where I had to replace entire blocks of code for something more robust than I had originally used. I also gained a better understanding as to how a webpage changes its formatting in order to accomodate screens of differing sizes. Although an experienced developer may see this project as rather basic, I am personally proud of the time and effort I put into making a webpage which responds to user input and screen size, as well as adding my own personal background to the site.

## Installation

1. Clone Responsive-Portfolio repository via SSH or HTML onto personal machine.
2. Open index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, and style.css in Visual Studio Code or similar Developer tool.
3. Scroll through each file and read comments to understand which block of code is used for particular parts of the webpage.

## Usage

- Edit code to understand how webpage changes in response
- I highly recommend using Bootstrap website in conjunction with scrolling through thhis code
- Replace my personal information with your own and adjust the code and styling to your needs.
