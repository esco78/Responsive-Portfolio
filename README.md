# Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

For this project I created a webpage which incorporates Bootstrap elements in order to make the site responsive to user's screen size. This webpage incorporates 3 HTML files all linked together in order to display an 'About Me', 'Contact', and 'Portfolio' page. My motivation behind this project was to dive in and get a first hand experience with bootstrap and its plethora of elements as well as allow myself to give some background about my personal life. Throughout the process, I gained a considerable amount of experience working with Bootstrap as well as learning to commit every change I make immediately to a GitHub repository in order to have a view of version histories. There were multiple times where I had to replace entire blocks of code for something more robust than I had originally used. I also gained a better understanding as to how a webpage changes its formatting in order to accomodate screens of differing sizes. Although an experienced developer may see this project as rather basic, I am personally proud of the time and effort I put into making a webpage which responds to user input and screen size, as well as adding my own personal background to the site.
