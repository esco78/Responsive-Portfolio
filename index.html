                        My name is Erick Salgado. I was born and raised in Livermore, CA where I currently reside. Often times, the average person, even in California, would have a hard time understanding where that is exactly, to which I describe as being about 30 miles east of San Francisco. I will be 24-years-old in one more week exactly and I am certainly ready to kick off my Kobe year with the mamba mentality not just towards learning to program, but also in all aspect of my life such as work and personal health. I currently attend the Coding Bootcamp offered via UCSD Extended with hopes of learning all that I possibly can about programming and a few of the common programming languages in order to enter the tech industry. I started out teaching myself to code in my spare time as a hobby and now I find myself here, taking that hobby seriously and challenging myself to make a career. Before attending this bootcamp, I received an AS in allied health from my local community college with an emphasis in biological sciences. Originally I was in the middle of my journey to become a radiologist but I have decided to take a detour and explore programming. Aside from schooling and work, I spend my free time exercising/lifting weights, reading, enjoying my girlfriend's company, and hiking and other outdoor related activities like sports. 
                      <div class="row">
                        <p class="col-12">
                          From a less professional and scholarly standpoint, I am an athlete at heart. My desire to learn programming comes at the surprise of even my closest friends and family members. I spent my entire childhood playing baseball and soccer year-round. A little known fact about myself is I used to play for the San Jose Earthquakes academy team when I was 16. It was an incredible experience to play under such expert coaching and training regimen. I was also fortunate enough to play under the former US Men's National Team head coach, Lothar Osiander, during my time of competetive soccer. Looking at my past, I am surprised as well I have chosen to explore a career in something which requires quite a large amount of time sitting and typing as opposed to being outdoors. This will be the most challenging course I have taken thus far and I am certainly excited to see where I will be by the end of this bootcamp.
